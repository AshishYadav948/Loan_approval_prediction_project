# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction System

This project uses machine learning to predict loan approval decisions based on applicant data. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and deployment using FastAPI for real-time predictions.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Notebook.ipynb` – Exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and model training.
- `loan_data.csv` – Dataset containing loan application records.
- `model.pkl` – Trained ML model (Logistic Regression or SVM).
- `scaler.pkl` – Preprocessing scaler used for feature normalization.
- `app.py` – FastAPI app for serving predictions via REST API.
